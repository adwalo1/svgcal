# svgcal
svgvcal is a cli-tool to generate calendar-pages. At the moment it's not really user-friendly, normally i just change the parameters in the code to get the results i need.

# How to make a calendar with svgacal
* Requirements
  * 12 Photos
  * A few pages thick A3-paper
  * a laser-printer
  * a binding-machine
  * a hole-puncher to make _single_ hole. You could maybe also use a drilling machine.
* Prepare 12 photos for the 12 months. The target size is 203 x 305 mm, your photos should have this aspect-ratio.
* Have the 12 photos developed on real photo paper in the size 20x30cm (the actual size is 203x305mm or 8x12 inch). I like to use [fotoservice.mediamarkt.de](fotoservice.mediamarkt.de), they only charge 0.45€ per piece and the shipping is just 2€ (i am not affiliated with them in any way, just a satisfied customer).
* Use svgcal to generate a calendar-page for each month
  * svgcal also has an option to import a ics-file.This is useful for marking public holidays on the calendar, but i guess this feature could also be used for marking birthdays or anniversaries of your family. If you have a google-account, you can use google's ready-made calendars with public-holidays (available for different countries). Google has a option to download these calendars as ics-file.
* Print the calendar-pages for january to november on the _backside_ of 11 of the photos.
  * Use a laser-printer (inkjets will not work)
  * My old HP-printer was able to feed the photos just fine. My new samsung printer not...the photo-surface is too slippery so the printer cannot feed the photo well. Place a piece of paper under the photo, and then fold 3 cm of the paper around the edge of the photo (the side where the printer will start feeding the paper). This will protect the photo surface and at least my printer can feed the photos this way just fine. 
  * Don't forget to use the correct paper-type in the printer-dialog. For my samsung-printer i use "card stock"
  * Repeat reading this instructions until you understand how you have to orient the pages so that the calendar comes out right in the end.
  * The calendar-page for december has to be printed on an extra white page. Note that standard A4-paper is too small... i cut the needed size from a A3-sheet. Also, I like to use a thick paper for the december-page and i use inkscape for printing the pages
* Design a cover-page for the calendar and print it out. Use a thick paper for the cover-page. Again, note that A4-paper is too small.
* Make a stack: begin with the december-page, the printed side should face up. Then place the photo with the november-page. The photo-surface should face down, the printed november-page should face up. Repeat with the other photos. At the end, place the photo where you didn't print anything, also here the photo-surface should face down. Finally place your cover-page, the printed cover should face up. 
* Now use the binding machine to bind the stack of papers. If you stacked the papers correctly, you will have the photo on one side and the printed calendar-page on the other side after opening the binded booklet.
* Use the hole-punch (or drilling machine) to make single hole at the bottom of the calendar. You can use this hole to hang the calendar at the wall

In the end you have a high-quality calendar with A4-size photos on real photo paper for just 6€!
